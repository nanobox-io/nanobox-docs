Teams let you and your fellow developers collaborate on apps deployed with Nanobox. Creating a team is simple. In your dashboard, open your account menu and click "Create a New Team".

Provide a name for your team and save.

## Switching Between Accounts
A team account essentially acts as a separate account. In your dashboard, you can switch between your personal account and a team account.

Next, you'll want to [add team members](/teams/manage/).
